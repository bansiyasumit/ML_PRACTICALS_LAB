## ðŸ“˜ Assignment 1: Linear Regression â€“ Predicting Student Marks

This project builds a simple linear regression model from scratch to predict student marks based on hours studied.

### ðŸ”¹ File: `assignment1.py`

### ðŸ”¹ Input
- **X (Hours):** [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 10]
- **Y (Marks):** [96, 85, 82, 74, 95, 68, 76, 84, 58, 65, 75, 50]

### ðŸ”¹ Method
- Calculates mean, slope (m), and intercept (c)
- Predicts using: `Y = mx + c`
